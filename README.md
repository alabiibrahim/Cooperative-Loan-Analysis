## Project Brief: 
Cooperative Loan Analysis

## Objectives

The aim of this dataset is to provide detailed information on loan applications submitted to a co-operative financial institution. It includes applicant demographics, loan details, and approval status, allowing for a comprehensive analysis of trends, customer behavior, and business performance.

1.	Analyze Loan Applications Across Demographics: Examine how age, marital status, education, and employment status influence loan application volume and approval rates.
   
3.	Identify High-Value Customer Segments: Discover which groups (e.g. age, education level) are associated with higher loan amounts and better approval chances.
   
5.	Understand Monthly Loan Trends: Track loan funding performance across different months to identify peak and low-performing periods.
   
7.	Explore Loan Purpose Distribution: Determine the most common reasons customers request loans and analyze the funding associated with each category.
   
9.	Assess Loan Term Preferences: Review preferred repayment terms among applicants to help design better loan products.
    
11.	Support Data-Driven Decision Making: Provide actionable insights to help the organization optimize loan products, marketing efforts, and risk management.

4.	Are there any seasonal patterns in loan demand?
   
5.	Which age group submits the most loan applications?
   
6.	Which age group gets the most loan approvals?
    
7.	How does marital status affect the number of loan applications?
    
8.	Do younger applicants (under 30) get loans approved as often as older ones?
    
9.	Which education level accounts for the highest loan amount?
    
10.	Are loan applications correlated with the level of education?
    
11.	Which employment group (employed, self-employed, unemployed) requests the most loan funding?
    
12.	Is there a risk in the high loan volume from unemployed applicants?
